This plugin allows you to give your registered community members the option to show links to their social networking profile next to their comments on your site and the administrator has the ability to choose which social networks are shown.

== Description ==

The Social Profiles Wordpress Plugin was conceived by [Sugarrae](http://www.sugarrae.com/) in an effort to help get the registered members of your blog more involved by giving them increased personal exposure by showcasing their profiles on selected social networking sites of your choosing, in addition to the standard website link on their comments. Upon activation, you choose which social networks will be shown on your site and the plugin creates a corresponding box on the user profile page. All a user needs to do is enter their username. The plugin will automatically create a link to their profile based on that username â€“ in graphical or textual form based on your preferences
